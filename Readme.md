# ModXBR
Like VanillaXBR? Like mods? This is for you!

While this isn't a fully hand-done upscale, expect some problems. I am actively working to fix issues I find in the pack.\
If you find any problems, please [make an issue on github](https://github.com/CodeF53/ModXBR/issues)!

## Caveats
This pack has no GUI inventory textures, and will never have any.

Because of this, this pack is designed to be used with [Default Dark Mode](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/default-dark-mode).

Why?
1. I play on 1080p, so 3x scaling ruins how it looks. [read about why here](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/3x-font)
2. Making XBR GUI textures actually look good is a lot of effort
3. ![Light theme burns my eyes](https://i.imgur.com/bNO16V2.gif)

## Minecraft Version?
1.19.2 only so far. I only plan on porting forward, when I update my own modded instance.
